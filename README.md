[Para espa√±ol, haga clic aqu√≠[URL NEEDED]](https://github.com/motoko-bootcamp/bootcamp/blob/main/README.md#graduation-levels-)

Hello and welcome to all motivated web3 learners. üëã

We believe the Internet Computer is an amazing piece of technology: cryptography, mathematics, computer science, blockchain technology, cloud technology... it's a major achievement for mankind to combine so much ingenuity and knowledge into one network. üìö

However, we believe most important aspect of the Internet Computer will always be the **community** and the people believing in it. üë¶ <br/> <br/>
Motoko bootcamp is a global event, organized by the community. All of the dev mentors, organizers, and contributors volunteering their time towards making this event possible have different backgrounds, but they share one huge passion: the **Internet Computer**! ‚àû

The goal of this bootcamp is to transmit our **knowledge** along with our **passion**.

We all know the world needs to change, and that technology alone won't solve everything, but we also believe that blockchain techology and the Internet Computer will play a major role in shaping the new world. üåç
<br/>
<br/>
We hope you'll use the knowledge acquired during this week to help us build a fairer and brighter world. üåà

# Structure of the week üìÜ

The bootcamp will start on the 16th of January and last until the 22nd. <br/>
Each student is responsible for their own progression.
<br/>

Participation in the bootcamp is open and free, you can attend any of lectures you are interested in and take on any challenge you want.<br/> However if you wish to be considered a **Motoko bootcamp graduate** and compete for prizes, you must:

- Be fully enrolled
- Complete all assigned challenges
- Submit your core project before the deadline on **[DEADLINE NEEDED]**.

# Lectures üé¨

Lectures will be held live on Zoom Webinar by mentors (each mentor is an experienced member of the community with who is actively developing on the IC).
Each lecture will cover one specific topic.

You can take a look at the **<a href="#" target="\_blank"> list of lectures [NEW URL NEEDED]</a>**.
<br/>

You can also view the full **<a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=e0a9c944a17afc070ed77f9f10688eaac557ebd0251c5e6d0b724253506d43b3%40group.calendar.google.com" target="\_blank"> Motoko Bootcamp Calendar </a>**.
</br>

If this calendar does not open up in your timezone, you can click the (+) symbol in the bottom right corner to add the events to your calendar and see them according to your own time zone. Each event contains a Zoom Webinar join URL, and if necessary there are also options to call in for audio (though we recommend using the join URL).

Each lecture will be recorded and available on Discord so you can keep up even if you are not available to watch it live.

# Daily guide [STILL RELEVANT?? MAYBE REUSE THE OLD ONES?] üìú

For each day of the bootcamp, a guide will be provided.

This guide will contains lessons on multiples Computer Science topics, those lessons are **highly recommended** for begginers, many people participating in this bootcamp have no coding experience and no background in Computer Science; if that's your case we believe it's important to acquire this fundamental knowledge. <br/>
However, don't feel overwhelmed by those topics and make sure to take your time. <br/>
All ressources will stay available after the bootcamp, the core objective of this week is to familiarize yourself with the Internet Computer. <br/> Even for an experienced developer, getting familiar with the Internet Computer and being able to develop on it in just one week is already quite challenging.

You can **[click here to check the topics](TOPICS.MD)** of the 7 days.

# Coding challenges üìù

Coding is all about **practice**! <br/>The more you challenge yourself, the better you'll get. üßë‚Äçüíª

There are two types of coding challenges:
- **Lecture Challenges** | Assigned after specific lectures
- **Project Challenges** | Semi-guided modules related to key aspects of your core project<br/>

If you wish to graduate from Motoko Bootcamp and compete for prizes, you will need to work **each day** on the challenges and complete them all.

# Core project üßë‚Äçüî¨

All information related to the core project are on **[this document](core_project/PROJECT.MD)**.

# Open mentorship hours üê•

Throughout the week there are some Open Dev Mentor Hours are scheduled, you should have at least 2 within your time zone. <br/>
These meetings will be the opportunity for all students to troubleshoot issues live and ask questions directly with a dev mentor. <br/>
This is open to everyone participating in the Bootcamp. <br/> It is highly recommended you attend at least one of these (or watch the recordings), even if you don't have any specific issues.

# Team meetings & Activities ü´Ç

Motoko Bootcamp is a self-driven event where each student works on their project individually, but it can still be helpful to have other students who can share your journey and help **motivate** you to stay on track.

Each student will be assigned a team of 10-15 students within a similar time zone, and then get private voice & chat channels on Discord where they can get together and discuss progress. We encourage each team to schedule a time each day to meet on the Discord voice channel to stay in touch.

# Assistance & Ongoing Troubleshooting üìû

This event is being run by volunteers and we have **limited** ressources, we won't be able to answer all questions at all times considering that we have hundreds of students, please understand this fact and make sure to follow **all instructions** in the **order** provided.

When you need help, follow these steps **in this order**:

1) Search on **Google** : most issues have their solution somewhere on the Internet, this is how real developers solve most of their problems. You need to make sure you've searched a for a few minutes on the Internet before moving to the **next step**. <br/>
2) Dig into the [list of resources and documentation [URL NEEDED]](https://github.com/motoko-bootcamp/bootcamp/blob/main/README.md#graduation-levels-). Most likely the answer you need will be in here if you dig enough, and the more practise you get navigating these resources the more effective and self-sufficient you'll be able to be as an Internet Computer developer.
2) Ask your **team** for help on **Discord** : you all have been assigned a specific team channel on Discord, this team is composed of people in your Time zone who are learning along with you. If you run into an issue, someone in your group probably encountered the same issue and might have the solution. You need to make sure you've asked your team and waited for a few minutes before moving to the **next step**. <br/>
3) Go to the <a href="https://github.com/motoko-bootcamp/bootcamp/discussions" target="_blank"> discussion section </a> and ask your question by creating a new topic. **Make sure** your issue hasn't be already answered in another topic. <br/> If you decide to create a new topic, please provide as much information as possible:
- When did you encounter the issue ?
- What is the exact error message ?
- Povide some screenshots to illustrate your request.

Note : your issue might be resolved only in the next mentor session if we need you to share your screen and the issue cannot be resolved in one simple answer. Make sure to stay active in the topic.

üö´ Do not **spam** the main channel of the Discord with your issue, and do **not** directly **DM** mentors. Disruptive behaviour that hinders the learning of other students will put you at risk to getting kicked out of the bootcamp. We've never had to do this before, don't be the first.

# Graduation Levels üéì
During Motoko Bootcamp #1, a student was either in a "beginner" track or "intermediate" track. For Motoko Bootcamp #2 we are changing this structure in favor of "Graduation Levels".

- **Graduated** | You submitted a core project that met the requirements and completed the assigned coding challenges. You'll earn a diploma but no prizes.
- **Graduated with honors** | You submitted a core project that met the requirements, and went above and beyond by also meeting the [graduate with honors requirements[URL NEEDED]](https://github.com/motoko-bootcamp/bootcamp/blob/main/README.md#graduation-levels-).
- **Graduated at top of your class** | You submitted a core project which included unique extra features beyond any requirements we provided, and the dev mentors found your submission exeptional.
- **Valedictorian** | One student will win the honor of being judge as having the most impressive core project submission.

# Prizes üéÅ

All Motoko-bootcamp **graduates** will receive :

- A **non-transferrable NFT-diploma** that will give special accesss to an exclusive Motoko Bootcamp **<a href="https://dscvr.one/p/motoko-bootcamp" target="\_blank"> DSCVR </a>** portal where students will be able to continue learning and collaborating with Dev Mentors and other graduates. üèÜ
